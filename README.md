# Location

**Description:** Your project appears to involve creating an interactive map using Mapbox GL JS. 
The button in the overlay suggests that clicking it will trigger some animation or action related 
to stops between RVS College and Gandhipuram on the map.

**Future improvements:** Instead of using a pre-defined array of bus stops, the bus could follow a real-time route, such as the route of a real bus. 
This could be done by using a real-time bus tracking API to get the bus's current location and destination.
